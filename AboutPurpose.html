		<h3>Welcome to Find Your Buddy! Our website was created for those in need to find a buddy to help them through life. Together, as future developers we collaborated to design a small site that would allow those with disabilities and mental illnesses to regain control of their lives. This is done through a comprehensive test in which the user fills out which conditions apply to them. Next, it will generate the animal that best suits them. If the user recieves a dog or a cat, the exact animal that is suggested will pop up; however, if the user recieves a different animal then it is suggested that the user reads about the animal in About Your Buddy, then checks out our Contact page to find shelters and trainers. We strive for perfection in our website and hope that it will help you greatly!</h3>
