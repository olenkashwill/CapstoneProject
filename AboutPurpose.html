		<h1>Purpose</h1>
		/* Add a photo of us three */
		<h3>Welcome, our goal for this website was to create a platform for those who are often over looked when we think of having a buddy. As future desginers we figured making a small site allowing people to get an idea of what animal companion they should look into. Along with a way for them to find a animal near them and a place to train with that new buddy. Not only will this hopefully help those out there, it's also a fun way to find a buddy perfect for you!</h3>
