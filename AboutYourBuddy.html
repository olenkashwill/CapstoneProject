			<h2 class="CatDog">Dog</h2> <h3>A service dog is a type of assistance dog specifically trained to help people who have disabilities, such as visual impairment, hearing impairments, mental disorders (such as post traumatic stress disorder), seizures, mobility impairment, and diabetes. Desirable character traits in service animals typically include good temperament or psychological make-up (including biddability and trainability) and good health (including physical structure and stamina). </h3> <cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service_dog</cite>
		
			<h2 class="CatDog">Cat</h2> <h3>A therapy cat is a cat trained to help ailing humans in a medically beneficial way to take advantage of the human-animal interaction for purposes of relaxation and healing. A therapy cat provides affection and comfort to people in retirement homes, nursing homes, schools, hospices, and other human service care facilities. A therapy cat's primary job is to allow unfamiliar people to make physical contact with it and to enjoy that contact. Children in particular enjoy hugging animals; adults usually enjoy simply petting the cat. The cat might need to be lifted onto, or climb onto, an individual's lap or bed and sit or lie comfortably there. In hospice environments, therapy cats can play a role in palliative care by reducing death anxiety</h3><p><cite>https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Therapy_cat</cite>
		
			<h2 class="MiniHorse">Miniature Horse</h2> <h3>This type of service animal has been on the rise in popularity since they’re a great choice for someone who needs physical support to walk. Many people who are blind use miniature horses as their guides instead of dogs, and there’s actually an entire Guide Horse Foundation for this very purpose. And apparently these horses are really good at their jobs. The species is naturally cautious, mild-mannered, and sharp-eyed, all of which make for a great service animal. And on top of all that, miniature horses can live for up to 30 years. That’s five to seven times longer than your average service dog.</h3>  <cite>https://disabilityguide.com/6-different-types-of-service-animals.html</cite>
		
			<h2 class="FerretParrot">Ferrets</h2> <h3>Another unlikely service animal, ferrets have the natural advantages of being easy-going, highly social, and easily transportable. Ferrets make great emotional support animals since they enjoy burrowing close to their owners, which can be extremely comforting to people needing emotional support. But ferrets make great service animals too. These critters are known for alerting their owners when they’re about to experience a seizure, and ferrets can also be trained to wake someone up, remind their owner to take medication, and even interrupt harmful behaviors. Not bad, ferrets.</h3><cite>https://disabilityguide.com/6-different-types-of-service-animals.html</cite>
		
			<h2 class="MiniHorse">Boa Constrictors</h2> <h3>This creature might not be the first animal you’d choose to keep in your home, but they actually make great service animals. These snakes are known for helping patients with bipolar disorder, obsessive compulsive disorder, and panic disorders, and there are even cases when these snakes can be used to prevent medical emergencies. One man in Washington has a friendly boa that will squeeze him more tightly when it senses he’s about to have a seizure, giving him enough time to take his medication or go to a safer location until his seizure passes.</h3><cite>https://disabilityguide.com/6-different-types-of-service-animals.html</cite>
		
			<h2 class="FerretParrot">Parrots</h2> <h3>This is a popular animal for treating psychiatric disorders, namely because many species of parrot have the ability to talk to their owners and deescalate them in stressful situations. A great example of this a man named Jim Eggers from St. Louis who relies on his service parrot, Sadie. The parrot has been trained to repeat the mantra, “It’s OK, Jim. Calm down, Jim. You’re all right, Jim. I’m here, Jim” to calm Jim down whenever she senses he’s about to have a violent episode. Jim used to say the mantra to himself, but now with Sadie’s help he can pre-empt episodes even before they start. Sadie is also trained to alert Jim when someone comes to the door and when he leaves the faucet running.</h3><cite>https://disabilityguide.com/6-different-types-of-service-animals.html</cite>
		
			<h2 class="MiniHorse">Potbelly Pigs</h2> <h3>Both highly intelligent and mild-mannered, potbellied pigs can be trained to do all the same functions as the traditional service dog. The only difference is that they’re far cleaner than dogs and also don’t shed as much. Sounds like a good bargain. Plus this particular species is known for being good with kids. Lois Brady from California takes her service pig Buttercup to schools to visit children on the autism spectrum. Since most children don’t have any preconceived ideas about pigs, Brady has found that fewer students are afraid of Buttercup than of a big dog. The pig’s gentle nature also come in handy when he encounters students with aggressive tendencies that would probably make a dog turn around and attack.</h3><cite>https://disabilityguide.com/6-different-types-of-service-animals.html</cite>
		
			<h2 class="MiniHorse">Capuchin Monkey</h2> <h3>Another very exotic service animal choice is the capuchin monkey. These little helpers are native to South America and weigh about 6 to 10 pounds. Capuchins are especially talented at grasping and retrieving, which makes them invaluable companions for quadriplegics and other disabilities that affect fine motor skills. These monkey can perform all kinds of tasks: bringing water, fetching phones, performing basic chores, opening doors, and even feeding someone. There’s an entire organization in Boston called Monkey Helpers that trains little capuchins to be the hands for people who can’t use their own.</h3><cite>https://disabilityguide.com/6-different-types-of-service-animals.html</cite>
