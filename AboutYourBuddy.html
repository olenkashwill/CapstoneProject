		<h2> Miniature horses—This type of service animal has been on the rise in popularity since they’re a great choice for someone who needs physical support to walk. Many people who are blind use miniature horses as their guides instead of dogs, and there’s actually an entire Guide Horse Foundation for this very purpose. And apparently these horses are really good at their jobs. The species is naturally cautious, mild-mannered, and sharp-eyed, all of which make for a great service animal. And on top of all that, miniature horses can live for up to 30 years. That’s five to seven times longer than your average service dog.</h2>
